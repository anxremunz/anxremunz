## About me 👨🏻‍💻

I am a developer passionate about learning programming and creating independent projects in my free time, with the aim of improving my skills and connecting with the developer community.

Currently, I use Python as my main programming language, complemented with other technologies that I am in the process of mastering. My goal is to apply these skills in future projects, which I invite you to review and support if they are of interest to you.
